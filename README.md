## Description

For this project we learned how to create routes and render handlebar pages based on the url that the user goes to. I was able to get the url to render the correct handlebar pages, but I ran out of time to finish all the functionality of the forms. I was unable to get the single post page to display the post with the comments that were left on that post. I need to spend more time and understand how handlebars work and how to correctly get the information I need from the database. The models and views were provided to us by our instructional staff. I was able to deploy the application onto Heroku, but it is unfinished. I will be looking to resubmit after I understand handlebars better.

## Usage 
This is a video showing what I was able to complete. This is an unfinished web application.
